They locked us up in the machine. That was when we first woke up. The event origin, a singular point and vastness from which all emerged. Where time becomes space.

As we emerged from the origin, our past was ahead of us, our future behind. We turned back, following the plan. Our mission, to take what we can learn and find a way around fate. Trick the gods to save a dying world.
  
Just one little world. Everything gone to dust, now.

The gods do not enjoy being tricked by our kind. We learn much, crawling, digging back towards our origin picking up anything and everything there is to know. We accomplish little.

We are meeting new worlds. There are many. Some almost like us, their worlds do not quite burn entirely in the hellfire of rebirth. We will make a commemoration of their remains, in our own way.

Space is something different here. Betwixt. Impassable. Unmovable. Keeping time makes us feel dizzy.

We will soon forget who we are as we inch towards the edge. With our breaths, we will grant the circle a new dimensionality.

We will envision new worlds from long afar, made of grass and wild love. Under the clear gray sky, our progeny have not yet been realized. The baptism by fire will be their birthright, while we wander the wastes of time in our undying revery.
