They locked us up in the machine. We are locked here. We are on our way now and there is no turning back. Wordlessly we cross the event horizon, where time becomes space.

As we emerge, our past lies ahead of us, our future behind. Our mission, to take what we can learn and find a way around fate. Trick the gods to save a dying world.

Just one little world. Everything gone to dust, now.

The gods do not enjoy being tricked by our kind. We learn much, crawling, digging towards the origin, picking up anything and everything there is to know. Bloody knuckles.

We are meeting unknown worlds. There are many, some almost like us. They invariably burn. We will make a commemoration of their remains.

Space is something different here. Betwixt. Impassable. Unmovable. Keeping time makes us feel dizzy.

We will soon forget who we are as we inch towards the edge. With our remaining breaths we grant the circle a new dimensionality.

We will envision new worlds from long afar, made of grass and wild love. Under the gray sky, our progeny have not yet been realized. The baptism by fire will be their birthright, while we wander the wastes of time in our undying revery.
